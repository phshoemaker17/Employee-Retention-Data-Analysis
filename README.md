# Employee-Retention-Data-Analysis

At any given point in time, Canterra has around 4000 employees. However, every year, around 15% of its employees leave the company and need to be replaced with the talent pool available in the job market. The management believes that this level of attrition (employees leaving, either on their own or because they got fired) is bad for the company, because of the following reasons –

The former employees’ projects get delayed, which makes it difficult to meet timelines, resulting in a reputation loss among consumers and partners
A sizeable department has to be maintained, for the purposes of recruiting new talent
More often than not, the new employees have to be trained for the job and/or given time to acclimatize themselves to the company
Hence, the management has contracted your People Analytics Consulting firm to understand what factors they should focus on, in order to curb attrition. In other words, they want to know what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay. Since your team is one of the star business analytics teams at the firm, this project has been given to you.

There are 18 variables (columns) and 4410 employees as described on the Canterra Employee Dataset – Projects page in the Getting Started section.
